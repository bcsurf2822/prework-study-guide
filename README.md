# Ben's Prework Study Guide

## Description

To get a head start on being introduced to the basics of CSS, HTML, and Javascript Rutgers sent the students a prework study guide to work on and to practice our skills.  I built this project to help myself, friends, and fellow students understand the basics of these three coding languages.  Working on this project helped me in a lot of ways because I had no idea any of the terminology of these languages.  It helped me get introduced and work hands on with the types of things I was reading and being taught through the modules.  I learned how to structure a webpage through the use of HTML, how to style a webpage with CSS, and make the website usable through JavaScript.  I also learned the basics of GitHub, Gitbash, and VS Code.  It is eye opening the things that people can do with these programs and awesome how people can collaborate on projects easily while working remotely.
